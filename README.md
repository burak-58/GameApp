# GameApp
Game applications running on top of Ant Media Server

You can make a video call while playing games.
You should build the project and create war file. Then upload and install it onto AMS.

### Chess:
I have used [chessboardjs](https://chessboardjs.com/) and I shared data between the peers using WebRTC Data Channel. 
2 peers should join to the same room to playy chess together.
